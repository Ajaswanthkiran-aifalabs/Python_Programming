comprehension
-------------
- Comprehension in python provides a concise and expressive way of creating a list,dictionary and set. There allows to create this data 
    structures in a single line of code.

- There are four types of comprehensions in python
        - list
            Syntax:   lst=[<output_expression> for <item> in <iterable> if <condition> ]
        - Set
            Syntax: s={ <output_expression> for <item> in <iterable> if <condition>}
        - dictionary
            Syntax:  dt={ key:value for (key,value) in iterable if <condition> }
        - Generator:- It is very similar to the list but the only diff is it used circular brackets and major diff is it does not 
                    allocate memory for the whole list. instead there generate each value one by one. 
            Syntax: gen=( <expression> for <item> in <iterable> if <condition>)
