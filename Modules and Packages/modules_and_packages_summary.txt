Modules 
------
- Module in python can be defined as a file that contains python definition and statements. It contains python code along with function,
    class and variables. python modules are the files with .py extension. 
- There are some uses of Modules like reusability, organizing the code.
- To import one python file in to other we use "import" keyword.
- The import statement is used to load all the functionality of one module to another.

        ex:     import example
                
                example.fun()   --> In example.py file fun() method is called

        we also import as 
            
                from example import fun

                fun()
    
- There are two types of python modules 
1. Built-in modules :-  math,os, sys......etc
2. user defined:- our own files and methods 



Packages
--------
- Packages do the work of organizing the files in python. Physically a package is a folder contains sub-folders are modules(files).
- When user created a directory and store some modules in it and if the directory should to accessed by other modules we need to convert
that directory into a package. To convert we use __init__.py file.  it identify the folder as package.

- user can import the Packages same as modules.

- A package contains modules and sub package. 

        ex:     form package import module1,module2

                module1.fun1()


    

Type Hinting
------------
-> Function annotation   "def func() -> int:"  - it return type is int.

- Type hinting is a way to specify the type of variable, function, class, method,
- Atomic vs Composite 
        - Atomic -- int,float,str,bool
        - Composite -- list,tuple,set,dictionary
- also we can create a user-defined data type and use it as type hinting.
- And python also provide additional tools for creating a specific types, including Type and NewType.

        - Generics
        -----------
        - When a user want to create a function,class or data which work on different data type then we can use Generics class and TypeVar
        function.
        best example is list which elements of different DataTypes.
        ex:     from typing import TypeVar

                T=TypeVar('T')

                def func(a: List[T])-> T:
                        return a[0]
                
                func([1,2,3,'a'])
        
        Generic is used to defined a Generic classes.
