Base except statement
--------------------
In try except we can write as
  try:
    code block
  except: --> If we did not mention Exception then it will cath all exception even from the system level so in order to catch only python
                exception we have to mention Exception
    code block
except Exception as e: --> If we want to print the exception then we have to use this


assert
------
- It is used to check whether the code if true or false.
- If false it will raise an AssertionError which stop the execution of the program.


Logging module
-------------
- we can use if in place of print statement for displaying debug mssg or error mssg.
